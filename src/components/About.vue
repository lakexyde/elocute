    <h1>About EloCute</h1> 
    <p align="left">EloCute is a way for language, linguistics, and speech teachers to help their students perfect their spoken mastery of a language. A teacher can use this web site 
      to create a virtual 'classroom' with students associated to it. The students are invited to login to their classroom in the EloCute companion mobile app for iOS and Android,
      and can be given assignments to complete. Students are given a written text that their teacher types into the EloCute web site, and they complete their assignment by speaking 
      the text into the mobile app. A grade is calculated automatically, based on the accuracy of the student input, by means of a speech-to-text utility in the app. The teacher is then
      sent the score on completion of the assignment.</p>
